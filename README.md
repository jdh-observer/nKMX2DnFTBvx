The Republic of Letters emerged as a vibrant intellectual community during the early modern era, acting as a cross-border network for individuals engaged in discussions spanning literature, philosophy, science, and diverse intellectual pursuits. It transcended national, religious, and political boundaries, nurturing friendship and collaboration through written exchanges. Yet, beneath the surface of friendship, it was also a realm marked by disagreements, rivalries, and polemics. Both aspects are extensively explored in qualitative historiography. However, current network analyses often overlook the presence of negative and hostile ties. This paper addresses the methodological challenge of analyzing negative tie data in historical networks and examines what changes in interpretation need to be made because of the nature of these ties. As a case study, we use the correspondence metadata of Antonio Magliabechi (1633-1714), a well-connected Florentine librarian, and the extensive Catalogus Epistularum Neerlandicarum â€“ a Dutch national union catalogue containing 584,723 metadata entries spanning bilateral epistolary exchanges from 1303 to 2013, housed in prominent Dutch institutions. Drawing upon the structural balance theory, we reveal how Magliabechi approached conflict resolution by strategically intervening in third-party relationships to maintain equilibrium within his Dutch correspondence network. His tactics ranged from fostering friendships between his contacts to concealing his associations with his friends' adversaries. Moreover, this paper delves into the challenges associated with processing vast amounts of epistolary metadata, particularly focusing on ensuring transparency and replicability in this research endeavor. Through this study, we shed light on the intricate dynamics of negative ties within historical networks, offering valuable insights into the Republic of Letters and its complexities.
